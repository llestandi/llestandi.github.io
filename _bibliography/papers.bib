	abstarct = {Two-dimensional (2D) flow inside a lid driven cavity (LDC) is shown to display multi-modal behavior in a consistent manner following the first Hopf bifurcation with varying Reynolds numbers (Re), depending upon the chosen spatial and temporal discretization scheme. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) following impulsive start, is used to show spatio-temporal growth and its nonlinear saturation of disturbance growth. Despite the fact that researchers have produced different value of Reynolds number when first Hopf bifurcation occurs (Recr1), DNS fundamentally differs from classical bifurcation studies involving global instability study of an equilibrium flow due to adopted nonlinear approach and not restricting the analysis to temporal instability only. The accuracy attribute of the DNS adopted here has been shown conclusively earlier via demonstration of a weak transient polygonal core vortex surrounded by relatively stronger gyrating vortices, which appear as a constellation after the disappearance of the transient, in [26]. Investigated LDC flow is characterized by multiple time scales at any Re, which are weak function of Re in selective intervals, punctuated by multiple bifurcations. The present investigation achieves two primary goals. First, it proposes to reconcile that Recr1 obtained by different numerical approaches can be shown to be in same range, provided the equilibrium flow obtained is of good quality, untainted by excessive diffusion. Secondly, we also show that for increasing Re following the first Hopf bifurcation, the flow during the limit cycle suffers a secondary instability, thus, requiring computation of the flow field over a longer time period. The first goal is met by exciting the flow field with a pulsating vortex inside the LDC for a very high accuracy scheme, we are able to show the universal nature of the primary bifurcation for Re in the range between 8020 and 8025. The flow at higher Re displays significantly increased spectral peaks, including broad-band spectrum and the understanding of all these have been aided by phase space portraits.}

The implication of Recr1 in the context of direct simulation of Navier-Stokes equation is presented here for LDC, with or without explicit excitation inside the LDC. This is aided further by performing detailed enstrophy-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the flow field. The flow has been computed by an accurate numerical method for two different uniform grids. POD of results of these two grids help us understand the receptivity aspects of the flow field, which give rise to the computed bifurcation sequences by understanding the similarity and differences of these two sets of computations. We show that POD modes help one understand the primary and secondary instabilities noted during the bifurcation sequences.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation has experienced tremendous improvements in the last decadesdriven by massive growth of computing power. Exascale computing has beenachieved this year and will allow solving ever more complex problems. But suchlarge systems produce colossal amounts of data which leads to its own difficulties.Moreover, many engineering problems such as multiphysics or optimisation andcontrol, require far more power that any computer architecture could achievewithin the current scientific computing paradigm. In this thesis, we proposeto shift the paradigm in order to break the curse of dimensionality byintroducing decomposition and building reduced order models (ROM) for complexfluid flows.This manuscript is organized into two parts. The first one proposes an extendedreview of data reduction techniques and intends to bridge between appliedmathematics community and the computational mechanics one. Thus, foundingbivariate separation is studied, including discussions on the equivalence ofproper orthogonal decomposition (POD, continuous framework) and singular valuedecomposition (SVD, discrete matrices). Then a wide review of tensor formats andtheir approximation is proposed. Such work has already been provided in theliterature but either on separate papers or into a purely applied mathematicsframework. Here, we offer to the data enthusiast scientist a comparison ofCanonical, Tucker, Hierarchical and Tensor train formats including theirapproximation algorithms. Their relative benefits are studied both theoreticallyand numerically thanks to the python library texttt\{pydecomp\} that wasdeveloped during this thesis. A …},

	abstract = {A new reduced order model (ROM) is proposed here for reconstructing super-critical flow past circular cylinder and lid driven cavity using time-scaling of vorticity data directly. The present approach is a significant improvement over instability-mode (developed from POD modes) based approach implemented in Sengupta et al. [Phys Rev E 91(4):043303, 2015], where governing Stuart--Landau--Eckhaus equations are solved. In the present method, we propose a novel ROM that uses relation between Strouhal number (St) and Reynolds number (Re). We provide a step by step approach for this new ROM for any Re and is a general procedure with vorticity data requiring very limited storage as well as being extremely fast. We emphasize on the scientific aspects of developing ROM by taking data from close proximity of the target Re to produce DNS-quality reconstruction, while the applied aspect is also shown. All the donor points need not be immediate neighbors and the reconstructed solution has equivalent relaxed accuracy. However, one would restrain the range where the flow behavior is coherent between donors. The reported work is a proof of concept utilizing the external and internal flow examples, and this can be extended for other flows characterized by appropriate Re--St data.},

	title = {Graph Neural Network Based Surrogate Model of PhysicsSimulations for Geometry Design},
	abstract = {Computational intelligent (CI) techniques have shown great potential as a surrogate model of expensive physics simulation, with demonstrated ability to make fast predictions, albeit at the expense of accuracy in some cases. For many scientific and engineering problems involving geometrical design, it is desirable for the surrogate models to precisely describe the change in geometry and predict the consequences. In that context, we develop graph neural networks (GNNs) as fast surrogate models for physics simulation, which allow us to directly train the models on 2/3D geometry designs that are represented by an unstructured mesh or point cloud, without the need for any explicit or hand-crafted parameterization. We utilize an encoder-processor-decoder-type architecture which can flexibly make prediction at both node level and graph level. The performance of our proposed GNN-based surrogate model is demonstrated on 2 example applications: feature designs in the domain of additive engineering and airfoil design in the domain of aerodynamics. The models show good accuracy in their predictions on a separate set of test geometries after training, with almost instant prediction speeds, as compared to O(hour) for the high-fidelity simulations required otherwise.},

	abstract = {In order to enable the industrialization of additive manufacturing, it is necessary to develop process simulation models that can rapidly predict part quality. Although multi-physics simulations have shown success at predicting residual stress, distortion, microstructure and mechanical properties of additively manufactured parts, they are generally too computationally expensive to be directly used in applications, such as optimization, controls, or digital twinning. In this study, a critical evaluation is made of how data-driven surrogate models can be used to model the residual stress of parts fabricated by Laser Powder-Bed Fusion. Residual stress data is generated by using an inherent-strain based process simulation for two families of part geometries. Three different models using varying levels of sophistication are compared: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture, and an interpolation-based method based on mapping geometries onto a reference. All three methods were found to be sufficient for part design, providing mechanical predictions for a CPU time below 0.2 s, representing a runtime speed-up of at least 3900 ×. Neural network-based models are significantly more expensive to train compared to using interpolation. However, the generality of models based on the U-Net architecture is attractive for applications in optimization.},
