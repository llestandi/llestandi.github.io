  Hi, I'm Lucas, associate professor (maitre de conférences) at [Ecole Centrale Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version?l=1), France. I mostly focus my research as member of [GeM laboratory](https://gem.ec-nantes.fr/en/gem-institute-2/) on the following aspects Reduced Order Modeling (intrusive) and Surrogate modeling (non-intrusive) techniques. This involves playing with computers for Machine Learning (ML) for science, POD/SVD, and tensor decomposition. I'm technically a mechanician, so I apply these techniques to various problems e.g. Complex flows, Additive manufacturing of metals , etc.
